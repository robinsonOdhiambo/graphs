# graphs
This repository is a collection of algorithms related to graphs. The algorithms are explained in my blog. https://thebigcsblog.com
The code is primarily for educational purposes but you may use it for whatever purpose you see fit.

# The Code provides implementation for the following Graph Algorithms
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Connected Components
* Topological Sort
* Strongly Connected Components (Kosraju-sharir)
* Network flow
* Dijsktra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* Bellman-ford Shortest Path Algorithm
* Kruskal's minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
* Prims Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
